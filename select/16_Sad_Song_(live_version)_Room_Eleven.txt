Does it have to be a sad song?
Isn't it a shame?
The ones I try the hardest with
Never stay the same

And I just can't decide if it's good or bad
The times I hold the dearest are the times we never had

We've yet to have

We've yet to have

And isn't it a sad song,
It's some jazz
How perfectly we fit today,
What yesterday we passed

And I just can't consider another in your place
Holding another hand, seeing another face

We've only had

We've only had

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

It is a goodbye song
It is time for the blues
Stomp away through shallow puddles
In your water walking shoes

We only had one exquisite corpse
Over ginger and Pim's,
And the kind of back scratching
That doesn't brake skin

But we will have, oh I know it!
We will have, oh I know it!

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame, oh it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

So I guess it's a sad song
And it's a shame
'Cause I think we made a love song
And I know you feel the same

We will have, I know it!
We will have, oh
