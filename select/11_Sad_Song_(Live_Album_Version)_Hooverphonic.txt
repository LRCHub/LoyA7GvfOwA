Now its time to move to the next level
Sore wet eyes that look at the devil
Tell me please that its time to leave
On the train I lost my intelligence
Found my love with good intentions
But its still time to leave
[Chorus]
I recorded the sound of your heart
I recorded the sound of your eyes
And I converted them into this sad song
That modulated these mysterious lights
